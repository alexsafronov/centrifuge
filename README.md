This project is to introduce and implement protocol framework for anonymized requests by a data owner to a data scientist. The purpose of an anonymized request protocol is to make it possible to use resource of a data scientist while maintaining full data confidentiality. All original data values are removed entirely and are replaced with "dummy" values in a way that does not allow for restoration of the original values. The column names are removed in order to exclude a possibility of identifiying the data origin. Not all data lines are used, but only a sample in order to protect information of the database scale. The resulting data, however, retains properties necessary for data-scientific work such as programming and analysis. The key is generated and it is kept by the data owner, so the owner can use it  to unlock the analysis results delivered by the data scientist.
