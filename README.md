This project is to introduce and implement protocol framework for anonymized requests by a data owner to a data scientist. The purpose of an anonymized request protocol is to make it possible to use resource of a data scientist while maintaining data confidentiality by removing all original data values entirely and replacing them with "dummy" values in a way that does not allow for restoration of the original values without the key which stays with the data owner. The resulting data, however, retains properties necessary for data-scientific work such as programming and analysis.
